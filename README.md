Imported the dataset, dove into data exploration, and prepared for the journey ahead with Python's powerful libraries - pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
Started with the basics, training a Linear Regression model to establish a baseline for salary prediction.
Took it up a notch with Polynomial Regression (degree=2), discovering the power of capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
Created visually appealing charts to showcase the predictions, enabling a clear understanding of the model's performance.
Raised the degree of Polynomial Regression to 4, providing a smoother curve for more accurate predictions.
Utilized the trained models to predict salaries, uncovering fascinating results:
Linear Regression: $330,378.79
Polynomial Regression (degree=4): $158,862.45
